        <p><strong>The Headquarters of Vitalis</strong> found here houses and teaches the students. Rules are in play to maintain discipline, order, and safe and secure environment for work and study. We offer a place to meet new people and where students, through soft skills, like communication and teamwork, learn to communicate, meet, and enjoy their time together. Our mentors ensure disciplined work while simultaneously offering their advices and companionship to their students, passing their skills and experience to them. We offer not only accommodation, but also meals and snacks throughout the day. We don't just work, but travel together too! Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden, are just of the few locations you can visit during your stay here, alongside the monuments and zoos found there too! <strong><a href="https://www.gut-wehlitz.de/" target="_blank">Check our main page for full information!</a></strong></p>
